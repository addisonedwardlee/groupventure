How does <div class="control-group"> work?  I don't have a class of control-group in my CSS file, but I define/use it in the leagues/edit.html file.



In header.html, how does ng-class work?  Why is it highlighting the selected entry without any css?
<li data-ng-repeat="entry in navbarEntries" data-ng-show="auth" data-ng-class="{ active: entry.isActive }">
      <a href="#{{entry.link}}">{{entry.title}}</a>
    </li>




I'm just not understanding the input logic in playercontroller.js
$scope.findOnePlayer = function(){
        angularFire(Players.find($routeParams.playerId), $scope, 'player')
      }




Line 8 <data-ng-options="c.$id as c.name for c in leagues"> in fantasyteams/edit
what is data-... and how is it used?  what is the c?
