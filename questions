In header.html, how does ng-class work?  Why is it highlighting the selected entry without any css?
<li data-ng-repeat="entry in navbarEntries" data-ng-show="auth" data-ng-class="{ active: entry.isActive }">
      <a href="#{{entry.link}}">{{entry.title}}</a>
    </li>



Line 8 <data-ng-options="c.$id as c.name for c in leagues"> in fantasyteams/edit
pulls in each c based on id and shows it as name.  If i reference the option later, I get c.$id.  What if i want c.name?



socialteams view.html
<button ng-click="addFriend(friends[socialTeam.friendsId-1])">Add friend</button>
the input for this function is whack because I can't access the array normally



In leaguescontroller, I have two watch functions that do the same thing but are split because I need to look at different variables.  This seems sloppy.  How can I refactor?
