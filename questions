How does <div class="control-group"> work?  I don't have a class of control-group in my CSS file, but I define/use it in the leagues/edit.html file.



In header.html, how does ng-class work?  Why is it highlighting the selected entry without any css?
<li data-ng-repeat="entry in navbarEntries" data-ng-show="auth" data-ng-class="{ active: entry.isActive }">
      <a href="#{{entry.link}}">{{entry.title}}</a>
    </li>




I'm just not understanding the input logic in playercontroller.js
$scope.findOnePlayer = function(){
        angularFire(Players.find($routeParams.playerId), $scope, 'player')
      }




Line 8 <data-ng-options="c.$id as c.name for c in leagues"> in fantasyteams/edit
what is data-... and how is it used?  what is the c?



socialteams view.html
<button ng-click="addFriend(friends[socialTeam.friendsId-1])">Add friend</button>
the input for this function is whack



In leaguescontroller, I have two watch functions that do the same thing but are split because I need to look at different variables.  This seems sloppy.  How can I refactor?
